Hello and welcome to my personal site!

My name is <a href="https://twitter.com/mjabali">Marcelo Jabali</a> and I'm a Principal Product Manager @ <a href="https://www.expediagroup.com">Expedia Group</a>. I lead Developer Experience initiatives across all components of the developer ecosystem, including environments, workflow automation, tools, and developer productivity. My focus is on enhancing developer satisfaction and operational impact.

I live in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego">San Diego, CA</a>.

I'm active on <a href="https://www.twitter.com/mjabali">Twitter</a> and <a href ="https://www.instagram.com/marcelojabali">Instagram</a>.

Prior to Expedia Group, I used to work at <a href="https://www.oracle.com">Oracle</a>, <a href="https://www.twilio.com/authy">Twilio</a>, <a href="https://www.tibco.com">TIBCO</a> and <a href="https://www.progress.com">Progress</a>.

You can find more detailed professional information on my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jabali/">LinkedIn</a> profile.

I publish <a href="https://github.com/mjabali">code here</a> when I can.

I love traveling, watching movies, beer, wine and trying out new types of food.

I'm a <a href="http://www.diabetes.org/diabetes-basics/type-1/">Type 1 Diabetic</a>, adopted, tennis player, ran a few half marathons and I love sports cars.

This website is my canvas, a space where I paint a picture of my life and passions. It's a platform where I can engage with you, share my knowledge and experiences, and hopefully, provide a source of inspiration and information.

Reach out if you want to talk about tech, developer enablement, technical documentation, travel, food or sports.
